# Sample code to construct a Barnes-Hut tree

## Summary

A sample implemantation of the [Barnes-Hut tree](http://arborjs.org/docs/barnes-hut) with Ruby. The Barnes-Hut tree is a quad-tree (octree in a 3D system) which is used for efficient simulations of n-body systems.

## Usage

    $ ruby barnes-hut.rb

It will provide the following two images.


Configuration of particles.

It requires cairo package. If you do not have it, just run

    $ sudo gem install cairo

before execution.
